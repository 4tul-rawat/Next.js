Few things to remember while working with Next.Js

Open a project
Install Npm - npm install
Since my portfolio is build in Next.Js. I need to install Next.Js dependencies. For that I can either copy files from the previous project. Those are .next files that we can copy
To check the application in developer mode simply run - npm start 
To build the project run  - npm run build 

Now how to push this into github
